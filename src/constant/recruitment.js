Our team members get to use their engineering knowledge to solve real-world problems. Our truly interdisciplinary projects apply technologies like robotics, process control, image recognition, machine learning and also incorporate knowledge from agriculture, biology and chemistry.Â 

Our members go through the engineering design process, develop their own creative solutions, prototype and build!

We schedule regular weekend meetings for members of each project as an opportunity for collaboration and discussion. Individual tasks are also assigned during the week.Â
